## Overview
For any Business, it’s important to understand customer requirements. Machine Learning allows companies to tailor products to consumer needs. How to accurately predict customers’ adoption behavior is becoming more important to many credit card marketers as competition increases. So how do credit card issuing banks navigate this scenario of consolidating rapid growth today while preparing for the future? The answer lies in adopting a more customer centric approach. If issuers are able to better predict consumer behavior, they have a stronger chance of offering highly personalized solutions. Adoption of artificial intelligence and more specifically machine learning offers this opportunity. 

## Business Case
Happy Customer Bank is a mid-sized private bank that deals in all kinds of banking products, like Savings accounts, Current accounts, investment products, credit products, among other offerings.

The bank also cross-sells products to its existing customers and to do so they use different kinds of communication like tele-calling, e-mails, recommendations on net banking, mobile banking, etc. 

In this case, the Happy Customer Bank wants to cross sell its credit cards to its existing customers. The bank has identified a set of customers that are eligible for taking these credit cards.

Now, the bank is looking for your help in identifying customers that could show higher intent towards a recommended credit card, given:

•	Customer details (gender, age, region etc.)

•	Details of his/her relationship with the bank (Channel_Code, Vintage, 'Avg_Asset_Value etc.)
